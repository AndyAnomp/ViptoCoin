## Our Mission
Leverage Blockchain technology and provide users with fast and secure transactions.
We believe Blockchain is the future for many purposes such as data storage, payments and operations. Integration of Blockchain for our daily use leads to higher efficiency in applications.

### Fast, Today
Time is one of the key elements in our lives. Especially when it comes to financial transactions, lack of existing money transaction speed, companies or individual users are facing delays. This leads to a slowdown in activities. ViptoCoin offers a solution to cover such bad processes. Time is money, money is ViptoCoin.

### Safe & Anonymous
Security is another very important point on which today's world stands. By using ViptoCoin you can make secure payments be done, which gives confidence to the community.

### Decentralized, Distributed
Applications are the future need for higher efficiency and cost reduction. ViptoCoin is your solution for decentralized Payments.

### Efficiency
ViptoCoin uses the NIST5 hash, which is chosen as the winning algorithm by the US Nation of Science competition. Combination of security and mining efficiency were the key points taken into account. NIST5 has been shown to be more power efficient and secure than other prominent algorithms.


# Why NIST5?
ViptoCoin chose to use NIST5 as its hashing algorithm because it has been proven to be more secure and power-efficient than other leading algorithms. NIST5 is a combination of the finalists and winner of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology Hash Function Competition (specifically BLAKE, Grøstl, JH, Keccak/SHA-3, and Skein). NIST5 was created fairly recently, and immediately saw use by other coins, but failed to see mainstream adoption.

Nist5 is a proof of work mineable algorithm that is NiceHash able and was resistant to ASICs formerly. This one is a combination of 5 different algorithms and is similar to Tribus. The 5 hashing algorithms that comprise Nist5 are Blake (Aumasson 2010), Grøstl (Gauravaram1 et al. 2011), JH (Wu 2012), Keccak (Bertoni et al. 2012), and Skein (Ferguson et al. 2010). It is a core heavy hashing algorithm and that can be mined using consumer-grade hardware like CPUs and GPUs (AMD / NVIDIA). Also, Nist5 is a power- efficient algorithm and since it uses core it was proven that it is not as ASIC resistance compared to other memory-heavy algorithms. It is true and even recently it became completely nonresistant with the release of Baikal ASIC miner BK-X.
